**Palettify** is a small library with **ZERO** dependencies that lets you add really cool effects to your images.

It scans the images you provide, extracts their color palette and creates a cool looking box shadow effect with a color of your choice based on the image's palette.
Along with box-shadow it can also be extended to add borders, backgrounds and etc.

After that, it attaches an event listener (that is totally configurable by you) and on each mouse enter or leave, it shows and hides a dope shadow effect that will make heads turn.

The style of the box shadow is also configurable by you!
